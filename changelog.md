    1.16v2
    The contained pack is an expansion of the pack described below, all alterations and additions made by Piogre, to add coverage of textures 
    that weren't covered in previous painterly pack iterations.
    Some additions are modified versions of textures provided as alternate options in the original Painterly pack by Rhodox.
    This pack is intended for use by the SummaXR server, but may be distributed at the discretion of the server owner.

---

    1.16v1
    The contained pack is an effort by Piogre to convert the SummaXR Custom Painterly pack to 1.16 as completely and accurately as possible.
    The Painterly pack was originally created by Rhodox http://painterlypack.net/, and continued additions were made to the pack by 
    GerbilCrab475 
    https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2745841-painterly-pack-continuation-project-fan-patch
    This pack only contains adjustments made to combine textures from the above sources to a single pack which functions in 1.16.  Minimal 
    additional content has been added.  If a decision is made to add new textures for new game features, it will be done in a new version.
    There are no plans to redistribute this beyond providing it to the server owner who provided Piogre with the base pack to make adjustments 
    to.
    Contributors to this pack include:
