    The contained pack is an expansion of the pack described below, all alterations and additions made by Piogre, to add coverage of textures that weren't covered in previous painterly pack iterations.
    Some additions are modified versions of textures provided as alternate options in the original Painterly pack by Rhodox.
    This pack is intended for use by the SummaXR server, but may be distributed at the discretion of the server owner.
    Any further non-major changes, and any further contributors, will be listed in the attached changelog file.

    1.16v1
    The contained pack is an effort by Piogre to convert the SummaXR Custom Painterly pack to 1.16 as completely and accurately as possible.
    The Painterly pack was originally created by Rhodox http://painterlypack.net/, and continued additions were made to the pack by GerbilCrab475 https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2745841-painterly-pack-continuation-project-fan-patch
    This pack only contains adjustments made to combine textures from the above sources to a single pack which functions in 1.16.  Minimal additional content has been added.  If a decision is made to add new textures for new game features, it will be done in a new version.
    There are no plans to redistribute this beyond providing it to the server owner who provided Piogre with the base pack to make adjustments to.

    Contributors to this pack include:

    Painterly Pack Customized Pack
    by rhodox

    Unless noted otherwise, all graphics in this pack were edited and created by me. A few textures were generously provided by various individuals and are included in the pack with permission. These individuals are credited under their individual contributions on the web site (www.painterlypack.net). The default paintings are NES sprites, and so belong to whoever made those games, I suppose.


    This is a Customized Loadout file, and as such, has only the options selected by the user that created it installed. If you would like to access or experiment with the other alternate options available, or the original loadout, then you will either have to download the standard pack, which contains all the options, or create a new customized loadout with the new options.

    This pack may be used in whole or in part by any owner of Minecraft, and combined with other texture packs, so long as credit is given and no profit or donations are solicited through that person's use of my textures and skins. You don't have to credit me if you use it with your youtube videos or promoting your server or things of that nature, but it's appreciated if you do.
    The pack is given away freely (barring restrictions as noted on the Painterly website), however, donations for the time invested and ongoing development and testing of The Painterly Pack are extremely appreciated. The Donate link can be found on at painterlypack.net, and if you got it from anywhere else, it's not the official source and probably out of date.
