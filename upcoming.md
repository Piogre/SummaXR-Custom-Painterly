    When i get to it:
        failsafe text for inventory menus
        custom leather?  see what oraxen does
        move this whole ass thing to git?
        
    On request:
        supporter skins?
        supporter waypoints?
        
    Awaiting third party:
        emotes (pending wahr actually using them)
        revisit water? (have this working with optifine but it breaks for non-optifine; been asking about a way to load one-or-other)
        enchantment glint? (currently broken in optifine)
        stuff for ui mod, if needed? mythickeys? (pending implementation/info)
        make use of version character (need stub added by wahr)
        alcohol -- buff up expanded system and revise numbers etc (awaiting further action on this system by wahr)
